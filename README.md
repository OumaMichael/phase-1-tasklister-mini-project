## Introduction
Welcome to the Foundation Project - To-Do List. This project is designed to help you manage tasks in an intuitive and interactive way. With basic functionality already in place, you'll have the opportunity to expand the site's features, allowing you to tailor it to your own workflow. The project's main goal is to have the user’s input dynamically affect the DOM, creating a more engaging and responsive task management experience.

## Features
### Basic Task Management:
- Add new tasks with a due date and time.
- Store tasks using Local Storage so they persist between sessions.

### User-Friendly Interface:
- Simple and intuitive design that works seamlessly on all devices.

### Responsive Design:
- Built to adapt to any screen size, enhancing usability on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

### Multiple Themes:
- Choose between different themes to personalize your experience.

## Future Enhancements
Once you have the required deliverables up and running, consider implementing some of these features:

### Task Operations:
- **Delete Function:** Remove tasks from your list.
- **Edit Functionality:** Allow users to modify tasks after they’re created.

### Priority Management and Sorting:
- **Priority Dropdown:** Assign priority levels (e.g., High, Medium, Low) that affect the text color (e.g., red, yellow, green).
- **Sorting Feature:** Enable tasks to be sorted in ascending or descending order based on their priority.

### Additional Task Details:
- Include extra input fields like priority, duration, or a specific due date.
